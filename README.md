**︻デ═一 Neural Network Aim-Bot for First-Person-Shooting Games in Python ︻デ═一**

## Prerequisites :

I would suggest you to setup a virtual environment and clone the repo from version control, its left to your discretion though.

**-> Major Requirements :**

1) Windows 10 64 bit and NVIDIA graphics card
2) CUDA Installation : https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive
3) Python >= 3.6
3) Cython
4) Numpy >= 1.18.5
5) Opencv-python
6) Torch >= 1.5.1, Torchvision >= 0.6 (Installation is a bit different for this, refer : https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 
7) PyYAML >= 5.3
8) Pywin32


**-> Minor Requirements :** (If imports are optimized, you can omit these)

1) Scipy
2) Tqdm
3) Matplotlib
4) Pillow


**-> Optional** : (If you decide to change the way you manage mouse_events and mouse movements) 

1) Interception Driver : https://www.oblita.com/interception.html (It is Digitally Signed) [Install with 'cmd' as Administrator]

```
Original Author's GitHub : https://github.com/oblitum/Interception [C++], 
Python Wrapper :           https://github.com/dc740/AutoHotPy

NOTE : Managing' Mouse-Inputs' depends on the game, normally games patch many mouse_events and movements,
So I resorted to this driver, if you dont know what you are doing when using this driver I highly recommend
you not to use it, because if not codedroperly in rare cases you could damage your PC, and I am not responsible
for any damage done to your computer, although if you dont tweak my code w.r.t that driver in 'd3adsh0t.py'
you should be fine.
