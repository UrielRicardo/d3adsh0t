## Disclaimer :

Managing' Mouse-Inputs' depends on the game, normally games patch many mouse_events and movements,
So I resorted to this driver, if you dont know what you are doing when using this driver I highly recommend
you not to use it, because if not coded properly in rare cases you could damage your PC, and I am not responsible
for any damage done to your computer, although if you dont tweak my code w.r.t that driver in 'd3adsh0t.py'
you should be fine.
