## Disclaimer :

**'d3dsh0t' is a FPS Game Aimbot, It is purely experimental and is intended only for educational purposes.**

**Aimbots are cheats and illegal in games. This repo is solely for educational purposes only.**

Sorry, but I am not going to upload my custom trained weights to this repo, since this repo is open source (available to everyone), its just one google search away from cheaters abusing it, and I am not a fan of cheating in 'online multiplayer games'.

If you truly believe in learning new stuff and would like to try out this repo, you should be able to build your own Data-Set and should be able to train a YOLOv5s model, this repo is solely aimed at those people who believe in learning and put out an effort.

## Instructions On Weights:

After having trained your 'Custom - Yolo - Model' paste your_model_weights.pt weights file in this directory, followed by verifying the weights file path at 'd3adsh0t.py'
